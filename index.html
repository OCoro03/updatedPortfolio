                    Hello, my name is Orlando and I am 21 years old. Some of my interests are reading books, playing video
                    games, and traveling to name a few.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In regards to my education, I decided to take the community college approach to save some money and get
                    my
                    gen-eds out of the way. I've earned a spot on the dean's list for my academic performance as well as
                    recognigtion from the NHS Phi Thetta Kappa. I intend to enroll in a 4yr institution after my certificate
                    completion and major either in Economics or Computer Science.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as the career side of things for me, I currently hold a research internship at one of Chicago's
                    oldest investment firms in the research department. Aside from that, I hope to get the experience needed
                    from this bootcamp to get an internship at a start-up by next summer. This will be very benificial to me
                    because this will bridge the gap beween my and a fortune 500 company which is my ultimate goal. Working
                    for
                    a start-up will show I know/worked in all aspects of the business on top of build up my resume. My
                    ultimate
                    goal is, like I said, to work for a fortune 500 company and work my way up towards a consultant role.
